# VictoriaMetrics Self-Metrics Catalog

Self-telemetry metrics emitted by VictoriaMetrics cluster components (vminsert,
vmselect, vmstorage), vmagent, and vmalert.

**Question answered**: "Is the metrics backend itself healthy — ingesting, storing,
querying, and alerting correctly?"

**Scope**: Internal `vm_*`, `vmagent_*`, and `vmalert_*` metrics exposed on each
component's `/metrics` endpoint. This is a **metrics catalog** — for operational
tuning guidance, troubleshooting playbooks, and cardinality management, see the
linked ops-focused skills.

---

## When to Use

> Use when diagnosing VictoriaMetrics cluster health, vmagent scrape/remote-write pipeline, or vmalert rule evaluation. Covers self-telemetry metric prefixes: vm_rows_inserted_total, vm_rpc_*, vm_cache_*, vm_http_requests_total, vm_slow_row_inserts_total, vm_rows_ignored_total, vm_concurrent_*, vmagent_remotewrite_*, vm_promscrape_*, vmalert_iteration_total, vmalert_alerting_rules_*, vmalert_recording_rules_*, vmalert_alerts_*. Grounded on victoria-metrics-cluster chart 0.44.0 (AppVersion v1.145.0), vm-operator chart 0.63.1.

## Deployed Configuration (Grounding)

| Component | Chart | Version | AppVersion | Port |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|------|
| vminsert / vmselect / vmstorage | `vm/victoria-metrics-cluster` | `0.44.0` | `v1.145.0` | 8480 / 8481 / 8482 |
| vmagent | vm-operator CRD `VMAgent` | operator `0.63.1` | v1.145.0 (operator-managed) | 8429 |
| vmalert | vm-operator CRD `VMAlert` | operator `0.63.1` | v1.145.0 (operator-managed) | 8880 |

**Pipeline**: Component `/metrics` → vmagent (VMAgent `scrape-cluster`, `disableSelfServiceScrape: false`) → vminsert → vmstorage → VictoriaMetrics.

ServiceMonitors are enabled for all cluster components (`serviceMonitor.enabled: true`).

## 1. vminsert — Ingestion Layer

vminsert receives samples from vmagent/remote_write clients, replicates (RF=2),
and forwards to vmstorage nodes via RPC.

| Metric Name | Type | What It Measures | Troubleshooting Use | Key Labels |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `vm_rows_inserted_total` | Counter | Total rows (samples) successfully inserted | Baseline ingest rate; drop = upstream problem or vminsert saturation | `type` (prometheus, influx, etc.) |

| `vm_http_request_duration_seconds` | Summary/Histogram | HTTP request latency | Slow writes = downstream vmstorage pressure | `path` |
| `vm_concurrent_insert_current` | Gauge | Currently active concurrent inserts | Approaching `maxConcurrentInserts` (48 in this env) = saturation | — |
| `vm_concurrent_insert_limit` | Gauge | Maximum concurrent inserts allowed | Reference ceiling for saturation calculation | — |

| `vm_rows_ignored_total` | Counter | **KEY — rows rejected** due to validation failures | Non-zero rate = schema/limit violations being silently dropped | `reason` |
| `vm_tcplistener_conns` | Gauge | Active TCP connections on the listen socket | Connection saturation signal | `addr` |
| `vm_tcplistener_accepts_total` | Counter | Total accepted TCP connections | Baseline connection rate | `addr` |

### `vm_rows_ignored_total` reason values (v1.145.0)

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Symptom | First Metrics to Check |
|---------|------------------------|
| Samples missing from queries | `vm_rows_inserted_total` (vminsert) vs `vm_rpc_rows_sent_total`; `vm_rpc_rows_lost_total` |
| Write latency spike | `vm_rpc_send_duration_seconds_total` rate; `vm_rpc_buf_pending_bytes`; `vm_concurrent_insert_current` vs `_limit` |
| Cardinality explosion / high churn | `vm_slow_row_inserts_total` rate (vmstorage); `vm_cache_misses_total{type="storage/tsid"}` |
| vmagent queue growing | `vmagent_remotewrite_pending_data_bytes`; `vmagent_remotewrite_errors_total` |
| Scrape targets disappearing | `vm_promscrape_targets_total{status="down"}`; `vm_promscrape_scrapes_failed_total` |
| Query timeouts / slow dashboards | `vm_slow_queries_total`; `vm_concurrent_select_current` vs `_limit`; `vm_http_request_duration_seconds` |
| vmstorage disk filling | `vm_free_disk_space_bytes` (below 10GB = readonly); `vm_data_size_bytes` |
| Alert rules not evaluating | `vmalert_alerting_rules_error`; `vmalert_iteration_missed_total`; `vmalert_iteration_duration_seconds` |
| Alerts not reaching Slack | `vmalert_alerts_send_errors_total`; check Alertmanager connectivity |
| Recording rules failing | `vmalert_recording_rules_error`; `vmalert_remotewrite_errors_total` |
| Rows being silently dropped | `vm_rows_ignored_total` by `reason`; check `maxLabelsPerTimeseries` (100) |
| Cache cold after restart | `vm_cache_misses_total` / `vm_cache_requests_total` — high miss rate is expected temporarily; `vm_slow_row_inserts_total` peaks during warm-up |
| RPC distribution skew | `vm_rpc_rows_sent_total` by `addr` — should be roughly even across 10 vmstorage nodes |
