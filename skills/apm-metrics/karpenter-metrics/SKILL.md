# Karpenter Metrics — Prometheus Catalog

Metrics emitted by **Karpenter v1.8.3** (Helm chart `karpenter/karpenter` from `public.ecr.aws/karpenter`).

**Pipeline**: Karpenter controller (`:8080/metrics`) → vmagent scrape (ServiceMonitor enabled in values) → VictoriaMetrics.

**Deployment**: 2 replicas, `kube-system` namespace, hostNetwork, on dedicated `critical-apps` node group (not Karpenter-managed nodes). ServiceMonitor enabled via `serviceMonitor.enabled: true`.

**Feature gates active**: `nodeRepair: true`, `spotToSpotConsolidation: true`.

> **Version note**: Karpenter v1.0+ uses the `karpenter_` prefix for all native metrics (renamed from legacy `karpenter_*` / unprefixed names in v0.32–v0.37). The `karpenter_disruption_*` prefix was renamed to `karpenter_voluntary_disruption_*` in v1.0. Some ALPHA metrics listed from v1.11 docs may not be present in v1.8.3 — these are marked.

## When to Use

Use when diagnosing Karpenter node provisioning, disruption decisions, scheduling latency, EC2 API health, spot interruption handling, or cluster utilization. Covers karpenter_nodes_*, karpenter_nodeclaims_*, karpenter_pods_*, karpenter_voluntary_disruption_*, karpenter_scheduler_*, karpenter_nodepools_*, karpenter_interruption_*, karpenter_cluster_state_*, karpenter_cloudprovider_*, aws_sdk_go_*, controller_runtime_*, workqueue_*.

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Symptom | First Metrics to Check | What to Look For |
|---------|------------------------|------------------|
| Pods stuck Pending (unschedulable) | `karpenter_scheduler_unschedulable_pods_count`, `karpenter_scheduler_queue_depth` | Non-zero unschedulable; check if nodes are being created |
| Nodes not being provisioned | `karpenter_nodeclaims_created_total`, `karpenter_cloudprovider_errors_total` | Zero creations + cloud errors = capacity or IAM issue |
| Slow pod scheduling | `karpenter_pods_startup_duration_seconds`, `karpenter_scheduler_scheduling_duration_seconds` | High p99 = complex NodePool constraints or EC2 launch delays |
| Excessive node churn | `karpenter_nodes_created_total` + `karpenter_nodes_terminated_total`, `karpenter_nodes_lifetime_duration_seconds` | Short lifetimes + high create/terminate = flapping |
| Consolidation not happening | `karpenter_voluntary_disruption_eligible_nodes`, `karpenter_nodepools_allowed_disruptions` | Eligible >0 but decisions =0 → PDB blocking; allowed=0 → budget exhausted |
| Consolidation stuck/timeout | `karpenter_voluntary_disruption_consolidation_timeouts_total` | Increasing = cluster too complex for simulation window |
| Spot interruptions | `karpenter_interruption_received_messages_total{message_type="SpotInterruption"}` | Frequency of spot reclaims; correlate with node terminations |
| EC2 API throttling | `aws_sdk_go_request_retry_count`, `karpenter_cloudprovider_duration_seconds` | High retry count + elevated p99 duration |
| InsufficientCapacity | `karpenter_cloudprovider_instance_type_offering_available` | 0 for desired types/zones = no EC2 capacity |
| Cluster state desync | `karpenter_cluster_state_synced`, `karpenter_cluster_state_unsynced_time_seconds` | synced=0 for extended time = scheduling on stale data |
| Controller saturation | `controller_runtime_active_workers` vs `max_concurrent_reconciles`, `workqueue_depth` | Workers at max + growing queue = scale replicas or tune concurrency |
| Leader failover issues | `leader_election_master_status`, `leader_election_slowpath_total` | Both replicas show 0 = no leader = no provisioning |
| Disruption budget exhausted | `karpenter_nodepools_allowed_disruptions`, `karpenter_nodepools_nodes_consuming_budgets` | allowed=0 + consuming>0 = budget fully consumed |
| NodePool at capacity limit | `karpenter_nodepools_usage` vs `karpenter_nodepools_limit` | usage ≈ limit = cannot provision more |

## Complements

- `skills/infrastructure/karpenter-consolidation` — operational patterns: why consolidation blocks, PDB issues, spotToSpot thresholds, instance type broadening. This skill provides the **metrics** to diagnose those issues.
- `skills/apm-metrics/go-apm-metrics` — Go runtime metrics (`go_goroutines`, `go_memstats_*`, `go_gc_*`) also emitted by the Karpenter controller binary.
- `skills/apm-metrics/k8s-workload-metrics` — container-level resource metrics for the Karpenter pods themselves.
- Scheduling constraint: restrictive pod anti-affinity or topology-spread rules can make `maxReplicas`/consolidation targets unreachable even when Karpenter metrics look healthy — check pod scheduling constraints before assuming a controller bug.
